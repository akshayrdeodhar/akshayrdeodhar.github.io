Welcome! I'm Akshay.

I'm a computer scientist interested in working on systems software, databases, compilers and infrastructure. I want to build correct, fast, and scalable software. ~~I was a rambling wreck from Georgia Tech.~~ I recently graduated with a master's degree in CS from Georgia Tech, specializing in Computing Systems. Take a look at my [resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lDEYajvxcl96x1H4cHi3-1PPJX0JLOMH/view?usp=sharing).


I'm interested in anything and everything that involves thinking. I'm also interested in lots of things that don't require thinking. Find out more [about](/about) me.
