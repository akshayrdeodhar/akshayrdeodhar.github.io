Welcome! I'm Akshay.

~~I'm a rambling wreck from Georgia Tech.~~ I am a Computer Science Master's student at Georgia Tech, specializing in Computing
Systems. I want to build correct, fast, and scalable software. Find out more [about](/about) me. 

I am looking for full time opportunities as a software engineer starting ~May 2023. 
I'm interested in infrastructure, systems software, compilers, databases,
and high performance computing- but am open to anything that'll involve
_thinking_ and writing code. Take a look at my
[resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lDEYajvxcl96x1H4cHi3-1PPJX0JLOMH/view?usp=sharing).
