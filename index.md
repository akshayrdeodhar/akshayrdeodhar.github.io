Welcome! I'm Akshay.

I'm curious about anything and everything that involves thinking. I also enjoy a lot of things that don't require thinking. Find out more [about](/about) me.

I ~~was a rambling wreck from Georgia Tech~~ recently graduated with a master's from Georgia Tech, and work on the CUDA programming langauge as a compiler engineer at Nvidia. I'm interested in working on compilers, databases, systems software infrastructure, and math.
