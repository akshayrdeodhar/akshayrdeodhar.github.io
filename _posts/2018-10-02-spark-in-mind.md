College techfests suck. With all their sponsors and their cool names and DJ's
(coming all the way from Portugal), they always turn out to be a dissapointment.

We have competitions, side events, and 'do event pe ek nakli workshop free'.
offers. Students somehow find wandering around in unknown colleges, and exorting
random students to 'build their portfolio' and 'participate in
extra-cirricular activites' a 'learning experience'. I know very few
professions which involve asking people to give you something for nothing. And
I sincerely hope that, these are not the professions which engineers want to
undertake for the better part of their lives. (But hey- engineers can 
(and therefore must) do anything (and apparently, everything)

Consider a typical 3 day fest. On the first day, college can be seen to be full of swarms of
volunteers moving around, clicking pictures and generally having a superb
boring time. On the second day, they rest. Instead, we have unsuspecting fools
from other colleges moving around, confused, asking around for a place in the
college which no-one has ever heard of.

B-List celebrities come and get humiliated, their voice lost in a
strategically planned collective clapping manuever. With good practice,
students become experts at such techniques. True masters have the power to rally the
whole crowd, and launch an adminration offensive on the speaker.

As you can see, techfests are my favourite.

But on the eve of our college's 'tech' fest, I noticed something I had not
noticed before. I saw who hadn't known each other a few weeks ago working hard
together. Tired and sleepy. Performing menial tasks. Putting up hoardings of
sponsors they had fooled with their promise of high footfalls. But working.
Working with determination, happy to be a part of something bigger.

I suppose it counts for something.
