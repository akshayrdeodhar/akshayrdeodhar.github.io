Have you ever wondered where your thoughts come from? At any moment, there is a
thought in my mind- verbal, non-verbal, a sound, something. There's something
at the top of my mind.

Propagating the thought _forward_ is easy- one of my middle school teachers
made a game out of it. You've got a minute to make a list of as many words as you
can, starting from the given word. There must be a meaningful link between every two
consecutive words. The one who gets the longest list wins. This is a "let 
the brain jump" game. I was good at this game, and used to come up with
long lists of words with wacky connections. Others made shorter lists,
but there was a _theme_, or a _direction_.

I tend to take 5-minute breaks at work. I walk out the office door,
and stroll in the sun. A minute of walking, and I find myself in the middle
of my stream of conciousness.

Between the time when I wrote the last paragraph and this one, I walked over to
the kitchen and grabbed a glass of water. Here's the thing- I left the desk
_hoping_ that I'd find myself in a stream of conciousness.  At the moment when
I got up, however, I was convinced that I wouldn't. I expected a single
thought- "I need to manifest a stream of conciousness somehow, and I won't be
able to"

Here's what happened instead.

- _I'm too sleepy, maybe thoughts die down when I'm tired_

- _Let me go into my room and walk around a bit, maybe lie down_

- I see chocolate wrapper , and threw it in the dustbin.

- _Possibly: Make a habit out of keeping surfaces clean, haha!_

- I see _farsan_ on the counter, grab a fistful.

- _Hmm, I'm eating loads of BAD snacks these days_

- _Sodium levels high, my face is becoming puffy, I should drink more water_

- _The friend who was here an hour ago wanted a SNACK. Huh. Lucky guy, eats unhealthy
shit all day and has no health problems_

- _I should eat something *juicy*_

- I eat a dried prune, and wonder if the bag is sealed. I keep a cup containing a half-eaten pickled egg in the refrigerator.

- _I should drink some water. Wow, I keep using up cups, now the shelf wont have an empty cup_

- I find an empty cup, fill it up with tap water.

- _Tap water, I wonder if I should filter it_

- I drink the tap water and am back at my desk.

The whole sequence of actions was on impulse- I saw stimuli, which led to
actions, which exposed me to more stimuli, which led to thought, which led to
action, and so on.

Interestingly, there was a parallel train of thought going on- 

- _At work, I end up doing things that I didn't intend to originally, 
going down rabbit holes and forgetting what I initially set out to do, I wonder
if I should write about that._


I'm going to do one more excursion, to generate another example. Hopefully, that'll help me recall
my general insight about these streams of thought.

> Its October 9, 24 hours since I typed the previous sentence. I'm back.

My general insight about these streams of thought is this- most of the time, there is _atleast_
one thing going on in my life which I will keep thinking about. Like a "strange attractor", all 
trains of thought have one station that they go to- the thing that I'm worried about. Once I get 
to that point, the name of the game is speculative problem-solving. Endless replays of ifs and thens,
contingency plans for situations that are never going to happen. If you let me out into the wild,
without anything to distract myself with, this is what I'll be doing.

The promised land, for me, then, is a state where my mind, when left to itself will jump to random
ideas, or be still.

If you play around a little bit with your thoughts, you might observe patterns similar to the ones
that I have.

It is very rare for a thought to manifest out of "thin air", in isolation. Most
trains of thought are tied to a stimulus in the environment, something captured
by your senses. An itch on my shin might trigger thoughts which have me
thinking about a sad memory. Scratching that itch might trigger a completely
new chain of thoughts which goes through- reels that I watched on facebook half
an hour ago, how I relate to those reels, to a friend, to a comment on one of
his posts, .....

These trains of thought aren't isolated. Sometimes, there's thoughts in the
background. For example, today, I remember repeatedly thinking of the phrase
"Gore Vidal" _while_ I was thinking of something else.

I find it interesting to trace these chains of thought backward to reach the
external impulses that initiate them.  With some effort, at the least, you'll
be able to find these "floating" nodes in the chain- flashes of activity in
your mind which verbally, or nonverbally are indicative of some thought or some
idea. Its hard to enforce order on this chain- and for good reason. In the
absence of a true authoritative record of the order in which my mind went
through thoughts, the order that my mind can recollect *becomes* my record.
With some reasoning, and memory, its possible to impose _partial order_. (I
definitely thought about A before I thought about C, but did B come first or
C?). However, the source of the chain of thoughts, and the logic that seeks to
recall the order in which they occur, _both_ belong to the mind, which makes
things complicated. In any case, this backtracking effort makes me _aware_ of
what I'm thinking about, of the fact that the train of thought was not deliberate, and
that it has no real _purpose_. 

This also becomes a form of meditation. (I don't like the word, I will never
admit to meditating, I'll play language games and call it "being quiet"). When
I am trying to be quiet, I consider an instance of my mind wandering to be a
tear in my fabric of calm. When I trace the path it took to a root (usually an
external stimulus), it feels like the tear is gone. Of course, after a few
moments, the mind wanders again. By repeatedly going through these cycles, the
mind can become still. Sometimes, these attempts will fail, and the mind will
keep wandering with a vengeance.

A slight variation of this is me trying to sleep. If my mind is racing when I
lie on my bed, I trace my thoughts backward, and try to construct a chronology.
Its funny- the cogntive effort of doing so makes me sleepy. When I reach a
point where I can't remember what the previous thought was, I fall asleep.

The easiest way for me to be quiet, is to first not be quiet. Eliminate all
distractions, and sit down in a comfortable, isolated environment, without a
time constraint. This allows me the luxury of letting my mind do whatever it
wants. Sometimes I deliberately think about something that is on my mind.
Sometimes I let my mind run on its own, jumping across connections between
ideas, converging towards my strange attractors- mostly my current worries, but
sometimes catchy songs, and rarely, nonsense chants. I am likely to start
yawning and fall asleep- and I allow myself to. There is no rush. After a
while, I start trying make my mind calm, and begin to backtrack my mind's
wanderings. Given the luxury of time, these efforts slow down my recurrent
thought loops, and I run out of things to think about. This might take several
hours. But when it happens, the "surface of my mind" becomes still. This is a
nice state to be in.

A detour- I imagine the mind as a surface of water. It _can_ be still, but
every stimulus that disturbs the surface sends out waves, each wave-crest
representing a thought. In the absence of more stimuli, and no deliberate
thought, those waves will die down, slowly, and the surface of the mind becomes
still again.

Serendipitous creativity, where ideas or beauty spontaneously jumps out of my
mind, without new stimuli, is very rare. (But I distinctly remember one
occurence of this phenomenon. This was a few years ago). However, when the
surface of the mind is still, I have experienced serendipitous _joy_- a tune,
sunlight or the wind on my skin, warmth, the shape of clouds. Sensory
experience becomes mere sensory experience- or as some mumbo-jumbo Gurus call it
"being in the moment".

This is a good way to examine my state of well-being. If stimuli are making my
mind race, especially towards my "strange attractors", I'm probably worried,
and not happy. The less this happens, the happier I am. Deliberate thought is
an exception- because it eliminates unconcious thought chains. I strongly
suspect that "keeping busy" forces deliberate thought, prevents the mind from
converging towards the "strange attractors", leaving you in a better state of
being than if you weren't busy. The best state of being, however, is one where
the mind is at peace, or is spontaneously joyous by default. Given that most
trains of thought run toward worry station(TM), the absence of "the next
thing that I'm worried about" will give me this state of being.

Now I'm devolving into things that I don't have good answers to. One way to 
solve the "next thing that I'm worried about" problem, is to solve the problem
in the _real world_. This quest usually makes you climb levels of something
similar to Maslov's hierarchy of needs. This is a good idea, to a degree.
The flaw, of course, is that there'll _always_ be a "next thing". There
might be long-ish periods where there is complete satisfaction, no
"next thing", and no thoughts racing towards worries. But a dissatisfaction
always appears on the horizon, given enough time.

The other way to solve this problem, is to solve the problem internally
instead of externally. Instead of making the mind calm by taking actions
in the real world, make the mind calm by being oblivious to the real world.
This is easier said than done. To be pragmatic, this should _not_ be done- for
example, if the "next thing" on your mind is hunger- not taking action in the
real world to resolve this will make you starve and die.

I'll offer one strategy that has a positive track record. First, understand
that any unconcious thought that races towards strange attractors is very
unlikely to produce useful knowledge. On the other hand, this thought does
not "feel" nice, and makes me restless. So, _if I were able to_, I should get
rid of unconcious thought. Thought loops are not an essential, they're harmful. Because I haven't renounced the world, I cannot be equanimous to
all outcomes. So I *will* analyze possibilties and try to make good decisions.
However, when I catch myself worried, I can replace my thought train with
deliberate thought. Do I want to think about this right now? If yes, then let
me _actively, logically, properly_ think about it, and try to get a useful
answer. If not, then know that I'm not going to remember any of what is going
on in my mind right now. If any of the imaginary problems that I am planning
for in my head occur, then I *will* deliberatly think about them then, and
ideas produced in that delibration will be strictly better than any
"solutions" that I make up in my head right now. This awareness doesn't
completely get rid of loops, but it does reign them in somewhat. Traceback
is also a useful tool here- when I realize that the "big problem" that 
I'm thinking about popped up in my head because of some completely
random stimulus, I become aware that I'm not conciously thinking about
the problem.
