It started with a memory. I'm sprawled on the floor, at 1am, home after watching
a bollywood movie with a paper-thin plot. There's an unread message from a friend
who I've been trying to meet for a while now. I'm thinking about _life_.

Has this ever happened to you? Sometimes when you wake up, sometimes when
you're lying around, you remember some music- maybe the lyrics, maybe the
tempo, maybe the tune. You don't remember the name, but you're consumed with a
desire to find and listen to that song. You hunt for it, you find it, and then
you listen to it a hundred times, spellbound. Then it becomes close to your
heart, etched in your memory. My strongest memory of this kind is remembering
"Don't let it bring you down" by Annie Lennox in Georgia Tech's relaxation room
(where sleeping is banned) after waking up from a nap.

It happeened to me yesterday, again. I remembered a fast tempo, something
that reminded me of a train, or a moving car, and the words "Gulabo Sitabo".
It struck me as the quintessential Coke Studio track- fusion, strong indie
voices. After floundering around for a bit, I found the song. There's no
"Gulabo Sitabo" in the lyrics (there's a movie of the name, unrelated to
the song). The song's name, is "[Rang Saari](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY8mAWdQFOA)".

I'm listening to it right now. Once again. For the 100th time. 

The song starts with a strobe, soft. A beat appears in the background- not
exactly a beat, a _melodious_ beat, and it becomes louder. A powerful voice
emerges- not delicated, but soulful. 

_Rang saari gulabi chunariya re, mohe maare ..__

Piano appears, singular notes at regular intervals. Then chords. Electronic
elements, gibberish in a loop, more strobes, all appear. The voice comes back,
and all the other elements fade into the background.

_Rang saari, haaaye. Rang saari_

Then a male voice (possibly autotuned), with an electornic motif, sweet and 
melancholy in the background. This is a duet!

_Mohe maare najariya saavariya re_

The song explodes. Its full EDM now. There's swishes, louder strobes, and
it feels like the tempo is becoming faster.

I'm in a car at a high speed on a never-ending highway, and this feels
like bliss. The strong has reached its crescendo.

_Javo ji javo_

The motifs, the electronic elements, the tempo, all of it continues. My mind
is racing at the same tempo. The singers in the duet alternate, and then
sing in one voice. Beautiful.

This is followed by softer taanas, and a flute motif. The softer tones fade,
and so does the music in the background one by one. The song has come to an
end. On cue, I start it again, listening to it for the 101st time, ready to
be lifted off by its melodies.
