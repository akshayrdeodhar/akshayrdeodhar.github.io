title: "Inktober: Nagging Illnesses"

A large fraction of adults frequently experience mild health discomfort. Lower
back pain, acid reflux, headaches, a constant cold. Difficulty sleeping, dry
skin, indigestion, bloating. Tiredness, constipation, rashes, dandruff. Hair
loss. RSI. People likely won't be running to the doctor for any of these symptoms.
Yet, if I dig down, everyone has something nagging them. (Shocking!)

In a random 24 hour day, I might have minor lower back pain, my right knee
creaking, a vague dryness in the throat, drowsiness after lunch, slightly
congested eustachian tubes, tingling in my left pinky, or see a new pimple 
on my forehead. When I notice something like this, I try to file it away, to
be given some thought later. I never give do. Because none of this is acute.
I rarely fall sick, can do pullups, hike long distances, and have below-average
BMI. Am I, then, healthy?

The natural follow up is, what does being healthy mean? Is it functional
fitness? Nearly everyone is functional, but to what degree? Is it the absence of
discomfort? Then few people are healthy. Is physical discomfort a default state?

The enumeration of symptoms, taken to its extreme, leads to deadly diagnoses,
a-la Three Men in a Boat. People are not, however, routinely dropping dead.
It is safe to not seek immediate treatment. Minor discomfort is batched up for the
next doctor's visit, idly googled, and mostly ignored. Perhaps, a remedy was
suggested, used for a short period, then forgotten. Perhaps a salve will
be used to soothe the symptoms when they become acute. No permanent cure
to these many minor nuisances is sought.

One possibility is that these multiple symptoms point to a single cause, which
could manifest something acute over time. Another is that each symptom 
has a separate minor cause, and the symptoms won't get worse. 

I've often probed doctors for an eternal key to health. If constantly observe,
change my lifestyle, control everything, can I be perfectly healthy, all the time?
Answers vary. 

Another possibility goes thus- the human body is subject to a constant fusillade
of assaults. There is no eternal health- the body must fight back, sickness,
and adjustment and medicine are necessary. Ayurveda says- everyone has certain
natural tendencies (_doshas_). Specific triggers which will upset your body's
balance, and make you sick. Tailor your lifestyle to your _dosha_, and stay healthy.

Here's my favourite- The environment has changed much faster than humans can
evolve. This constant tension causes discomfort. But the body is also
extremely resilient, robust, adaptable, and is self-repairing, *especially*
in a hostile environment. We're going to be fine / see you when I have a lifestyle disease.

As always, I do not have answers.
