advice"

With everyone working / studying / whatever from home, it is likely that people
are using Skype. A few days ago, (back when I used Debian) I had noticed that my
laptop was having performance issues, and had a look at the processes running in
the background, and saw MySQL, Postgres and Skype. You can stop database servers
can starting automatically in Linux by doing the following:

	sudo systemctl disable postgresql.service

Then, when you want to fire the server up for development, do

	sudo systemctl start postgresql.service

> Remember: *start* and *stop* are one time actions. *enable* and *disable* will
> decide whether the process is automatically started at bootup. 

Now, onto Skype. I didn't see any *service* for skype which I could disable. And
according to htop (cool program, much better than *top*), it was eating up a
considerable amount of memory- who the hell sits on 800MB of RAM while doing
nothing (well, firefox, for one)?

So what I did was this- I used to install and uninstall skypeforlinux before and
after every meeting. It turns out that this is not needed. Recently I found out
that it provides a setting where you can disable this unruly behaviour

	Skype -> Tools -> Settings -> General

> And change **this**:

> To this

![Skype with bad settings disabled](/assets/skype_disabled.png)

If you already knew this, cheers! If you did not, I implore you to save your
RAM. To those with a ton of RAM, what can I say?
