title: "The perils of reading nonfiction"

After a long hiatus, I've started reading regularly, once again. I joined goodreads, partially as a way to track "My List", and found out that it was an effective replacement therapy for a linkedin/social media/hacker news addiction. While trawling through my friends' lists, I found a lot of nonfiction. This, combined with this urge to learn something useful with my reading habit, made me turn to nonfiction. I'll tell you what books I am reading. One of them is quite _racy_- "The Red Queen: Sex and the Evolution of Human Nature". The Red Queen is a motif from Alice In Wonderland. The "red queen" refers to an environment where you must constantly run forward to be able to stay at the same place. The book's thesis is thus- evolution is not merely adaptation to a static environment, but a competition with _other agents who are also evolving_. It goes further and says that the main competition is with members of your own species- both of the same gender, and the opposite gender. Interesting thesis, juicy bits like "_Courtly love is about passing wealth to sons so they can be successful adulterers, cuckolding heiresses_" and controversial ideas. _I'm sold_. Fun read. There's just one little problem. _This is supposed to be nonfiction. Is any of this accurate?_

I've always had an aversion to nonfiction. 

A part of the reason is silly. Just as I make fun of those students who study regularly (while inwardly wanting to become like them), or laugh at those who go jogging (while wishing for the stamina for running a marathon), or sniggering about people who take think about style and contrast and high quality footwear.. [Caution! Don't blow your cover!], I also used to think that non-fiction readers are _not fun_ and _too serious_.[^1] before I became one of them.

[^1]: I no longer judge atleast 2 of the other 3 things.

But there is another part of the aversion, which is driven by logic. Nonfiction can be about Evolution (The Red Queen), Success (Outliers), Business (The Personal MBA), Finance (One up on wall street), Economics (Freakonomics), History (Sapiens), Food (In Defense of Food), and so on. I find all of these interesting (in no particular order), but _I have no formal background in any of these_. As a result, I might take everything at face value, and will not be able to detect _untruth_. While reading nonfiction, the same concept is usually hammered upon so many times[^2], that you will eventually agree with the author's viewpoint, by default. Because the author is frequently a journalist, and a skilled writer, you'll eagerly devour the prose, enjoying the tantalizing nuggets and the feeling of knowledge. Because I don't scrutinize nonfiction like I would a research paper- attacking every sentence, highlighting and adding rude questions, fighting to convince myself that it is correct, with nonfiction, acceptance is the default. So I run the risk of gathering a lot of incorrect information, or opinions disguised as knowledge. This is what scares me about reading nonfiction. I'm not saying that nonfiction is _wrong_, but that _it might be, and if it is, you will probably not know the difference_.

People I know (hello आजी) have argued that fiction is dangerous, that people become immersed in fantastic worlds, and carry ideas unsuitable for the real world back when they return[^3]. I beg to differ. I think we humans are clever enough to separate _explicit fiction_ from _explicit fact_. But I fear for our abilities to separate fact from fiction.

Knowing that nonfiction is unreliable, reading a _textbook_ seems better (and believe me, I have tried), because that will have gone through more rigorous scrutiny from _academicians_ (who I will trust over other groups). But reading a textbook as _leisure_ is not fun. I like reading Computer Science textbooks, but I _am_ a Computer Scientist by profession (believe it or not, in a few days I will be deemed to be a _Master_ of Computer Science). 

I want to learn about things other than CS. "I'm interesting in anything that requires _thinking_" (I'm also interested in things that _don't_ require thinking). Because reading textbooks from *k* different areas takes a lot of effort, nonfiction/popular science has become a shaky middle ground that I hesitate to, but sometimes do tread upon. 

This is also why I found _Godel Escher Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid_ and _Soul of a New Machine_ so cool. (both Pulitzer winners in nonfiction). In one, I had to reason through the ideas presented, sometimes so much so that it made my head hurt. The other was more of a _story_, and the author was not trying to say "Microkernels are better than monolithic OSs because [insert some "early man used microkernels for thousands of years and that's what we are built for" joke here]".

So what do I do? An effective way to educate myself about evolutionary biology, health, economics, finance, history, psychology and philosophy would be to put in the effort and read good _textbooks_. This will not be a source of entertainment (although Learning Is Fun, and unironically so). This will be reading that I will do to properly understand a subject. So far, I have read parts of _Psychology Applied to Modern Life_ and _Overcoming Gravity_. At the same time, I will read nonfiction, but I will not try to "apply the knowledge that I gained" from it. Nonfiction is for amusement and for impressing people in conversations.

**Chekov's Gun**. 
In the beginning of the post, I said "I'll tell you what I'm reading" but never did. Here's a nonfiction listicle, without epistemic status.

1. **Godel Escher Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid**: An elegant fugue of math, music, AI, art, with self-reference as the central thread. Dense chapters interspersed with fun dialouges between Achilles and the Tortoise. Never finished this one, but this got me into Computer Science, and for that, I'm glad.

2. **A Random Walk Down Wall Street**: A personal finance book that _makes sense_. I have always had this nagging suspicion about the stock market- if the price _is_ based on sentiment, then why even look at the fundamentals? This book says, "sure, technical analysis seeems stupid, but guess what- fundamental analysis isn't great either!". Introduces the "firm foundations" and "castles in the air" theories, and gives a wonderful analogy to explain why some mutual funds outperforming the index says nothing statistically significant about their superiority.

3. **The Soul of a New Machine**: Young, ambitious, overworked, underpaid computer engineers racing against time to build a computer in a skunkworks project in a computer company of a bygone age. Very inspiring, a delight to read.

5. **Atomic Habits**: For once, self help with some concrete advice that sometimes works.

6. **In Defense of Food**: Interesting ideas about the way food should be grown, cooked, and ~~consumed~~ eaten that would make my parents very happy.

7. **Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat**: A _cooking technique_ book that talks about cooking concepts instead of listing out recipes, and gives advice instead of hacks, tips, and tricks. The show, too, is _so good_.

I'd love to hear about what you have to say about this!

[^2]: A friend said this about Sapiens- Yes! I get it! Agriculture was a mistake! The plants domesticated us! How many times will you tell me this? Fair point, but I still liked Sapiens a lot.

[^3]: Sounds like _Hero of a Thousand Faces_ huh?
