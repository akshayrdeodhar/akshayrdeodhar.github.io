It's been a long time since I devoured a book in one sitting, and boy does it
feel satisfying. As the title makes obvious, I read "The Catcher in the Rye" by
J.B Salinger. Maybe it was the writing style, maybe it was the long gap which
got to me, but I found it to be phenomenal. It's quite short (finished it in
about 3 hours).

The thing about this book is, it is not a description of events- atleast not
completely. It's just follows the protagonist's stream of conciousness, as it
jumps from incidents in his past, people he liked and hated, and childhood
traumas. The protagonist is this 4-times expelled, 16 year old schoolboy with
wealthy parents with a thousand vices, called Holden Caulfield. He kind of tells
the story of his descent into depression and madness, caused partially by his
troubled past and the convoluted way in which his mind works.

Holden has a hundred vices- using intoxiants as a minor being the least of them.
He is a habitual liar, highly skilled at constructing falsehoods and making them
believable. Throughout the story he judges people as "phonies". That's his label
for people being something they aren't just to achieve some end, while being one
himself. What redeems him is his brutal honesty to *himself*, and his intense
suffering for failing to do right.

The events depicted are straightforward- a boy expelled from a prestigious
school loafs around in New York for four days, sinking deeper and deeper into
the tar pit of depression. Over those four days, we follow his *thoughts* in
first person, as he talks about his dead younger brother Allie, whose baseball
mitt which has poetry written on it, numerous roommates from the schools he got
expelled from, and his apt observations about what is wrong with people.

Besides the content itself, the way author employs slang, and his
"window into the protagonist's mind" style are things I have seen nowhere
else.
