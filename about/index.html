title: About Me
---

<p>I am a undergraduate student in my third year studying Computer Engineering at College of Engineering, Pune</p>

<p>I like mathematics (discrete math more than calculus), Computer Science (and Programming too). </p>

<p>I wanted the blog to be mixed- with some articles about programming, CS and
Math. I have not written anything yet. You can, however find code I have written
on <a href="https://github.com/akshayrdeodhar">github</a>. But because there are no technical posts yet, I will concentrate on my hobbies in this page.</p>

<p>I use Ubuntu and Vim, and am in the process of shifting to Debian Buster. I love C, because of KnR, David Malan and my DSA professor. I like python, too. I am enthusiastic about functional programming, and am currently learning Scheme with SICP.</p>

<p>This blog (like most of my writing) is a product of reading a <em>lot</em> of books. I have a policy of criticising any writing that has 'social significance', 'a bold message', or 'a moral'. This is subject to change if I actually read something, upon which I form an informed judgement. But <strong>NEVER</strong> talk to me about Arundhati Roy. I read an excrept in TOI, and I still have nightmares.</p>

<p>I mostly write light stuff which does little other than entertain. Recently, I found out that the stuff I was claiming to be <em>poetry</em> was in fact limerick. (It's better that way)</p>

<p>Now to the good stuff. I whiled my schooldays away reading novels. The authors I like are Douglas Adams, Wodehouse, Terry Pratchett, Asimov, Tolkein and George RR Martin. The only non-technical non-fiction I have read is Bill Bryson (and boy do I love it!). In fact I extracted a moral from his "Life and Times of the Thunderbolt Kid" - "It is okay for other people to drink alcohol".  Douglas Hofstader's Godel Eschler Bach influenced me to a great extent (I have not, however finished reading it yet.)</p>

<p>I have an unfulfilled dream of running a long Wild-West+ Pirates + Magic + Math DnD campaign, and have all but given up hope of doing it.</p>

<p>I like music of all kinds (but anything my sister listens to is off limits). I can, by trial-and-error play tunes on the Harmonium or Keyboard, but definitely am not a <strong>good</strong> player.</p>

<p>I play chess, and love stuff like the Evan's Gambit. I used to play Badminton. Currently, I am learning rowing.</p>

<p>I am very enthusiastic about trekking and climbing trees. Because this is my blog, I feel no shame about bragging here. So here is a real quote about me.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>No trek is complete without [some nickname I wish not to mention] climbing a tree</p>
