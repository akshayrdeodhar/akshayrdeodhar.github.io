title: About Me
---

I am a undergradurate student in my second year studying Computer Engineering at College of Engineering, Pune

I like mathematics (discrete math more than calculus), Computer Science (and Programming too). 

I wanted the blog to be mixed- with some articles about programming, CS and Math. I have not written anything yet. You can, however find code I have written on [github](https://github.com/Bri9k). But because there are no technical posts yet, I will concentrate on my hobbies in this page.

I use Ubuntu and Vim, but have tremendous respect for Debian and Emacs. I know C somewhat, but have not solved KnR completely yet. I like python, but do not write pythonic code. I am enthisicastic about Lisp, and am currently learning it.

This blog (like most of my writing) is a product of reading a *lot* of books. I have a policy of criticising any writing that has 'social signifincance', 'a bold message', or 'a moral'. This is subject to change if I actually read something, upon which I form an informed judgement. But **NEVER** talk to me about Arundhati Roy. I read an excrept in TOI, and I still have nightmares.

I mostly write light stuff which does little other than entertain. Recently, I found out that the stuff I was claiming to be *poetry* was in fact limerick. (It's better that way)

Now to the good stuff. The authors I like are Douglas Adams, Wodehouse, Terry Pratchett, Asimov, Tolkein and George RR Martin. The only non-technical non-fiction I have read is Bill Bryson (and boy do I love it!). In fact I extracted a moral from his "Life and Times of the Thunderbolt Kid" - "It is okay for other people to drink alcohol".  Douglas Hofstader's Godel Eschler Bach influenced me to a great extent (I have not, however finished reading it yet.)

I have an unfulfilled dream of running a long Wild-West+ Pirates + Magic + Math DnD campaign, and have all but given up hope of doing it.

I like music of all kinds (but anything my sister listens to is off limits). I can, by trial-and-error play tunes on the Harmonium or Keyboard, but definitely am not a **good** player.

I play chess and badminton, but have never won any competitions.

I am very enthusiastic about trekking and climbing trees. Because this is my blog, I feel no shame about bragging here. So here is a real quote about me.

> No trek is complete without \[some nickname I wish not to mention\] climbing a tree
