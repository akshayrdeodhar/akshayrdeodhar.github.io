I don't understand how the world or life works, but I'm curious, and I like living.


## Work

I work as a compiler engineer at Nvidia, on LLVM optimizations and code generation
for the CUDA programming language. Before this, I was an MSCS student at
Georgia Tech, focussing on Computing Systems. I'm interested in systems,
compilers, databases, HPC. I'm inclined towards projects that lie at the
intersction of implementation and theory. From a theoretical standpoint, I'm
interested in parallelism, concurrency, algorithms, and programming languages.

Before Nvidia, I've done a little bit of everything-

- **Spring 2022, Spring 2023**- TA for Advanced Operating Systems (CS 6210) at Georgia Tech
- **Fall 2022**: Interned at [Sambanova Systems](https://sambanova.ai/), working on an MLIR-based compiler for a DSL for implementing Pytorch-style operators on their custom hardware.
- **Summer 2022**: Interned at Nvidia, on the [Fleet Command](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/products/fleet-command/) platform for edge device orchestration, working on Go microservices, Kubernetes, and logging infrastructure.
- **Spring 2021**: Interned at [Veritas](https://www.veritas.com/), in Infoscale, working on a Kubernetes Container Storage Interface plugin for the Veritas Cluster Filesystem.
- **Winter 2019, Summer 2020**: Interned at IIT Kanpur, under [Dr. Swarnendu Biswas](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/swarnendu/), working on automatic format selection for Sparse Matrix-Vector Multiplication (SpMV) on GPUs.
- **2017 - 2021**: Was a part of the COEP Satellite Team, working on Attitude Determination and Control, mostly on C, Python and GMAT simulations for a solar sailing satellite's orbit and orientation. I was Subsystem Lead in the year 2020 - 2021. 



## Life

This is a personal website, but it is also my blog- the posts are scattered and
mostly not Deep CS posts, but hey! Other stuff is fun too! If you want to see
my code, look at my [github](https://github.com/akshayrdeodhar). If you like to
read, have a gander at my
[goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/161505204-akshay-deodhar).

I ~~hope to~~ do things in life other than CS- I've at different points in time
been into playing the harmonium and the keyboard, calisthenics, trekking
(or "hiking"), Sci-Fi and Fantasy, Wodehouse, Douglas Adams, classical music
(western and Hindustani), Chess, and Badminton. I enjoy cooking, and am
becoming better at it, one dish at a time. I've written some weird but
entertaining articles for our college magazine, and served as editor for a
year. I have a long-unfulfilled wish of running a Dungeons and Dragons campaign
in a highly detailed steampunk world. I learned a bit of rowing (sculling)
during my summer break after second year, but have a tendency to fall into the
Mutha river from the stablest of boats. I learned a bit of Fencing (foil) at Georgia
Tech. Now I'm trying to do a freestanding handstand.

I used to be an introvert before I met some wonderful people who "adopted" me,
and I keep meeting more. I love talking to people, so if you like this blog,
write me an email!
